## üìñ My Story

I've been using Medal.tv since 2019. Over the years, I've accumulated thousands of clips that I wanted to save locally. I kept asking Medal for a feature that would let me download all my clips (or lots of them) at once, but unfortunately, it never came.

After waiting for so long, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build this tool. It's my way of ensuring that all my memories are safe and sound on my own terms. And now, I'm sharing it with the community in the hope that it helps others like me!
